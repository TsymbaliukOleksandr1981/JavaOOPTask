There has never been a more tragic story than this one of Romeo and Juliet… It was a love at first sight, boundless and everlasting. And pointless death because of families excessive feud. Montague and Capulet are leaders in the city of Verona but they also blooded enemies. Two old men couldn’t even remember what was the cause of their feud. All members of their families hate each other and barely defend themselves from each other. The Prince of Verona didn’t want endure these fights anymore, because they disturbed the streets of the city and citizens had to participate in feuds. Both of them will die if either of them breaks the peace. That was the new rule for Montague and Capulet and their relatives. But it was not easy to follow it…
